This project demonstrates the use of the main communication peripherals available on the STM32F407G-DISC1 (Discovery) board.
It provides initialization and simple usage examples for the following peripherals:

GPIO (basic LED/BTN control)

UART (serial communication with PC or modules)

SPI (high-speed communication with external devices)

I2C (sensor and peripheral interfacing)

CAN (controller area network for automotive/industrial applications)

The goal of this project is to serve as a learning and reference project for low-level programming of STM32 peripherals.
